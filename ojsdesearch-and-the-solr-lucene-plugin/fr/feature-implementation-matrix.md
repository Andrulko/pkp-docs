# Feature Implementation Matrix

The feature implementation matrix details search front-end and back-end features that must be implemented to provide minimum search functionality that guarantees compatibility with the current OJS search as well as additional optional features. It also contains back-end features that provide additional administrative advantages to providers or improve index maintenance.

Every entry in the matrix contains

* a short feature description including its relevance to the different deployment options where applicable,
* the OJS authorization level to access the feature,
* whether it is a feature already present in OJS' search implementation or whether it is a new feature,
* a description of the feature's business value,
* an approximate implementation effort classification differentiating between the OJS back-end and user interface,
* alternative implementation options \(if any\),
* test cases \(if defined by FUB or their partners\) and
* comments

The complete feature implementation matrix can be found here:[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArYsBcy\_S9NkdFlBS0VqcE9wQjFHU3NhOFBFT191dHc&pli=1\#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArYsBcy_S9NkdFlBS0VqcE9wQjFHU3NhOFBFT191dHc&pli=1#gid=0)

The feature implementation matrix is meant as a specific guideline for the project owner to select and prioritize features to be implemented in future projects. It also may be used as an implementation guideline for 3rd party service providers executing future implementation projects.
